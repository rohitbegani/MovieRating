MovieRating
===========

A simple movie rating app on ruby
It is a simple movie rating app written in ruby. It is inspired from the MovieRating app taught by codecademy.
This just something I did for practice, then again it can be used to make something big. Though I know that it has nothing 
new and many of its functions may be redundant or not used in the best way possible still it's a try. And a newbie like me 
might learn loads from this code.
